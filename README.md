# Denoising-Autoencoder-using-tensorflow-for-DIH-images

Autoencoder.ipynb contains Denoising autoencoder made from scratch as well as using tensorflow.

cancertransfer_learning_forSNR_OSELM.ipynb contains implementation of Extreme Learning machine and transferleearning on extreme learning machines as well as tradiotional and CNN autoencoders in keras.

The results of ELM are available after code  under title ELM where "recon" denotes reconstructed images. 
Note-
This repository only contains a part of code written haphazardly to gather the observations.
Complete code and all the observations have not been included as these are yet to be compiled and published in a research paper. 

Complete organized code and all observations along with documentations will be made valiable by June 2020 as soon as paper is published.
